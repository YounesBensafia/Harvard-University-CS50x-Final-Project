# DoIt! : A todo list web application 
#### Description:
For my final project, I created a ToDo web application. In most applications, managing data—such as creating, deleting, and updating entries—is crucial. The purpose of this project is to learn how to manage data effectively, connect a database to the application, and bridge the front end with the back end and It allows users to manage their tasks.

The main features include logging in if you already have an account, or signing up if you don't, I have also handled errors to make sure everything works smoothly . After logging in, you can add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks.  And finally you can logout.
